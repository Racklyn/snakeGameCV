The famous **Snake Game** using computer vision. This project was created from the video _[Snake Game using Opencv Python + 3080 Ti Giveaway](https://youtu.be/w26Ze6lP02Y)_, available in the Youtube channel [Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYUjYU5FveRAscQ8V21w81A).

## New features
In addition to the features implemented during the video, I also implemented the following:
- Random update of food image when the snake eats it
- Adaptability to video capture dimensions

## Technologies üíª
- Python 3
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
